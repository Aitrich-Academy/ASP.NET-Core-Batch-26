    </p><em>hyper text markup language</em><strong>HTML</strong>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development, used to create structured and visually organized web pages. It consists of a series of elements and tags that define the content of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and tables. HTML works in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, allowing developers to build dynamic and responsive websites. Since it's a markup language rather than a programming language, HTML is relatively easy to learn, making it accessible for beginners while remaining an essential tool for advanced web development.
