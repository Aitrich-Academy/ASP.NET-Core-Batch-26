   <pre> <h1>                                Japan</h1></pre>
<pre>     Japan is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast coast of the Asian mainland, 
     it is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea 
     in the south. The Japanese archipelago consists of four major islands—Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu—and 
     thousands of smaller islands, covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi). Japan has a population of over 
     123 million as of 2025, making it the eleventh-most populous country. The capital of Japan and its largest city is Tokyo;
     the Greater Tokyo Area is the largest metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37 million inhabitants as of 2024. 
     Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. About three-quarters of the country's
     terrain is mountainous and heavily forested, concentrating its agriculture and highly urbanized population along its 
     eastern coastal plains. The country sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, making its islands prone to destructive earthquakes 
     and tsunamis.

     The first known habitation of the archipelago dates to the Upper Paleolithic, with the beginning of the Japanese Paleolithic
     dating to c. 36,000 BC. Between the fourth and sixth centuries, its kingdoms were united under an emperor in Nara, and later
     Heian-kyō. From the 12th century, actual power was held by military dictators (shōgun) and feudal lords (daimyō), and enforced
     by warrior nobility (samurai). After rule by the Kamakura and Ashikaga shogunates and a century of warring states, Japan was 
     unified in 1600 by the Tokugawa shogunate, which implemented an isolationist foreign policy. In 1853, a United States fleet 
     forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. 
     In the Meiji period, Japan pursued rapid industrialization and modernization, as well as militarism and overseas colonization.
     In 1937, Japan invaded China, and in 1941 attacked the United States and European colonial powers, entering World War II as
     an Axis power. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under 
     Allied occupation. Afterwards, the country underwent rapid economic growth and became one of the five earliest major non-NATO
     allies of the United States.</pre>
    <pre> <h2>Japanese Culture</h2></pre>
 

<pre>     Japan is renowned worldwide as a nation steeped in a culture that combines both tradition and modernity. 
     Thousands of years as an isolated island country allowed Japan to undergo various cultural evolutions in
     solitude, creating a truly unique traditional culture. As connections with other countries grew, Japanese 
     tradition was influenced and altered to create the unique culture of modern Japan, evident in its 
     combination of traditional concepts with the latest technology and art that astound the rest of the world.
