    <h1>JAPAN</h1>
    <br><pre><font color="green" size="5" FACE="ALGERIAN">
    Japan is a liberal democracy with a record of upholding civil and political rights,
     but its laws and systems to protect rights are weak. Japan has no laws prohibiting 
     racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination, or discrimination based on sexual
      orientation or gender identity. Japan has a law prohibiting sexual discrimination 
      in the workplace only. Civil society groups have long called for a national human
       rights institution. Serious human rights issues include an asylum and refugee 
       determination system that rarely grants refugee status, a “hostage” justice 
       system that detains criminal suspects for long periods to coerce confessions, 
       use of the death penalty, and a huge psychiatric industry that uses arbitrary 
       detention and use of physical restraints. The Japanese government continues to 
       actively support the expansion of fossil fuels both domestically
     and abroad, contributing to the global climate crisis.
